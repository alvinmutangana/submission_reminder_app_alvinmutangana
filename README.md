Submission Reminder App

Automate student submission tracking and reminders using Shell scripting

The Submission Reminder App is a simple yet practical shell-based application that helps lecturers or administrators track which students have not submitted their assignments.

You’ll use two key scripts to manage the app:
-create_environment.sh – sets up the full app environment.
-copilot_shell_script.sh – dynamically updates the current assignment being tracked.

Instructions

cd submission_reminder_app_<your-username>
run: bash create_environment.sh
You'll be prompted for your name, creating a directory named submission_reminder_{yourName}/
